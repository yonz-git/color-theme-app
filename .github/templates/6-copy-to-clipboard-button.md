### Acceptance Criteria

- A "Copy to Clipboard" button is available.
- Clicking the button copies the hex code to the clipboard.
- A confirmation message appears indicating that the color has been copied successfully.
- Confirmation message disappears after 3 seconds

### Tasks

- Create a CopyToClipboard component
- Use [navigator.clipboard.writeText()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText) API to copy the hex code to the clipboard ( Note that it is async )
- Introduce a state that handles the confirmation message
- Utilize useEffect to set a 3 second timeout to reset the state
